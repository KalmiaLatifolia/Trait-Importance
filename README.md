# Trait Importance
This repository contains code to accompany the future manuscript tentatively titled **The predictive power of remote sensing data for biological distributions**

In its current state this is a working repository. Code is in flux and subject to change.

The data files for this project are too large for storage on github. We anticipate archiving them upon completion of the project.
